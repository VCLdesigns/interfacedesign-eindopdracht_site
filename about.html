                <h1>The Addams Family</h1>
                <p>
                    The Addams Family is a group of fictional characters created by American cartoonist Charles Addams.
                    The Addamses are a <strong>satirical inversion</strong> of the ideal American family; an eccentric, wealthy clan who
                    delight
                    in the macabre and are unaware that people find them bizarre or frightening.
                    Addams Family characters include <a href="#gomez">Gomez</a>, <a href="#morticia">Morticia</a>, Uncle Fester, Lurch, Grandmama, <a href="#kids">Wednesday and Pugsley</a>.

                    Gomez Addams was the master of the Addams household and the Addams patriarch, married to Morticia and
                    the
                    father of Wednesday and Pugsley.
                    Gomez professed <em>endless love</em> for his wife, Morticia. He had studied to be a lawyer, but rarely
                    practiced,
                    one of the running jokes being that he took great pride in losing his cases. He was also pleased with
                    the
                    fact that his law class had voted him the man <strong>"Least Likely to Pass the Bar"</strong>.

                    Morticia Addams (n√©e Frump) was the matriarch of the Addams Family, a slim woman with pale skin, clad in
                    a
                    skin-tight black hobble gown with octopuslike tendrils at the hem. Certain sources suggested she may be
                    some
                    <strong>kind of vampire</strong>. She adored her husband, Gomez, as deeply as he did her.

                    Wednesday was
                    said to have been named after the phrase, "<strong>Wednesday's child is full of woe</strong>" from the poem Monday's
                    Child.
                    She is a
                    <em>sweet-natured, innocent, happy</em> child, largely concerned with her fearsome pet spiders. A favorite toy
                    was
                    her Marie Antoinette doll, which Pugsley had guillotined.

                <p>
                    Pugsley is a <em>devoted</em> older brother and an inventive and mechanical genius. He is Wednesday's sidekick and younger brother, cheerfully helping
                    her
                    in her evil deeds.
